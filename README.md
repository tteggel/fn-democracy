# Fn Democracy
Create, run and report on a simple poll. An experimental app for [Fn](http://fnproject.io) and OCI.

## Principals
  * Minimal data collection. Make it as difficult as possible to de-anonymise votes.
  * Results only visible after poll closes. No anchoring.

## Features
  * Create a new poll. Give it a name a small number of options to put on the ballot. Get a single shareable, public ballot URL for participants and a private admin URL.
  * Vote on a poll. Visit the ballot URL from the create step above. Click on the option you wish to vote for. Get a confirmation that your vote was cast or an error.
  * Close a poll. Visit the private admin URL. Select the "close" button. Get a confirmation that the vote has been closed. Link to public ballot URL. Public ballot URL shows poll results, date poll opened, date poll closed.

## Developing

## TODO
  * Private admin URL
  * Poll closing and counting
  * Pretty the HTML
  * Un-ugly the /new function
  * Short URLs / proxy for the object store PARs
